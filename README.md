# Project 1

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

### Description
This is a simple book review website designed as part of Project 1 of the cs50 (Web Programming with Python and Javascript) course, which I auditted. I used mainly Python Flask and SQLAlchemy for designing the backend and HTML, Jinja2 Templating language and bootstrap 4 for the front end. I also connected by book review site to the Goodreads API, which has a massive databse on metadata on books, such as book reviews, ratings etc to give more information on each book on my website. I published the Website using Github Pages.
